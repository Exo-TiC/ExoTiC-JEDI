# Get Started with JEDI with the Padawan Tutorial

To run this tutorial:

  1. Make sure you have exotic_jedi installed!
  2. Download your JWST *uncal.fits files for your observation from MAST
  3. Start at **0_*.ipynb** with the quick look and saving the time stamps as a text file for ease
  4. Run stage 1 of the STScI pipeline using **1_*.ipynb** to fit the ramps and produce 2D integration images
  5. Run certain steps of stage 2 of the STScI pipeline using **2_*.ipynb** to grab important files such as the wavelength map for the observation
  6. Explore the 2D integrations, clean things up and generally Extract Diagnose and Investigate in **3_*.ipynb**
  

*Light Curve Fitting and playing with Engineering Data are coming soon!*
