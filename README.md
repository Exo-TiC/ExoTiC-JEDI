JWST time series reduction and analysis pipeline used in Early Release Science of the Exoplanet WASP-39b with JWST NIRSpec G395H [Alderson, JTEC ERS team, et al., 2023, Nature](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv221110488A/abstract)

For a guide to using the pipeline, check out the [padawan](https://github.com/Exo-TiC/ExoTiC-JEDI/tree/master/notebooks/padawan) tutorial notebooks. Currently these will step you through a first look at the ***uncal.fits** files through to **stellar spectra**. 
*Light curve fitting is coming soon!*
